mod_sqli.c -- Apache sqli module

To play with this sample module first compile it into a
DSO file and install it into Apache's modules directory 
by running:

$ apxs -cia mod_sqli.c

Then activate it in Apache's apache2.conf file for instance
for the URL /sqli in as follows:

#   apache2.conf
LoadModule sqli_module modules/mod_sqli.so
<Location /sqli>
SetHandler sqli
</Location>

Then after restarting Apache via

$ apachectl restart

you immediately can request the URL /sqli and watch for the
output of this module. This can be achieved for instance via:

$ lynx -mime_header http://localhost/sqli

The output should be similar to the following one:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 31 Mar 1998 14:42:22 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.4 (Unix)
Connection: close
